                <em>Use of Blockchain Technology.</em> The Company utilizes
                experimental cryptographic technologies and blockchain
                technologies, including tokens, cryptocurrencies, stablecoins,
                “smart contracts,” consensus algorithms, voting systems and
                distributed, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks or systems
                for the activities on the DR Center. You acknowledge and agree
                that such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative,
                and that therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding
                the operation and effects and risks thereof and the application
                of existing law thereto.

                <em>Certain Risks of Blockchain Technology.</em> The technology
                utilized in DR Center depends on public peer-to-peer networks
                such as Polygon that are not under the control or influence of
                the Company and are subject to many risks and uncertainties.
                Such technologies include the DR Center, which the Company may
                have limited or no ability to change, other than ceasing to
                support certain “smart contracts” and adding support for new
                “smart contracts”. You are solely responsible for the
                safekeeping of the private key associated with the blockchain
                address used to participate in the activities on the DR Center.
                The Company will not be able to restore or issue any refund in
                respect of any NFT due to lost private keys. If you are not able
                to spend or use an NFT due to loss or theft of the corresponding
                private key or otherwise, you will be unable to exercise your
                rights with respect to such NFT.

                <em>Certain Risks of Smart Contract Technology.</em> NFT and
                other digital assets relevant to the DR Center depend on the DR
                Center System, or other smart contracts deployed to Polygon,
                some of which may be coded or deployed by persons other than the
                Company. Once deployed to Polygon, the code of smart contracts,
                including the DR Center System, cannot be modified. In the event
                that the DR Center System or other smart contracts are adversely
                affected by malfunctions, bugs, defects, malfunctions, hacking,
                theft, attacks, negligent coding or design choices, or changes
                to the protocol rules of Polygon, you may be exposed to a risk
                of total loss and forfeiture of all NFTs and other relevant
                digital assets. The Company assumes no liability or
                responsibility for any of the foregoing matters, except as
                otherwise expressly provided by these Terms or required by
                applicable law.

                <em>Asset Prices.</em> The fiat-denominated prices and value in
                public markets of assets such as ETH and NFTs have historically
                been subject to dramatic fluctuations and are highly volatile.
                As relatively new products and technologies, blockchain-based
                assets are not widely accepted as a means of payment for goods
                and services. A significant portion of demand for these assets
                is generated by speculators and investors seeking to profit from
                the short- or long-term holding of blockchain assets. The market
                value of any ETH, and NFT may decline below the price for which
                you acquire such asset through the DR Center or on any other
                platform. You acknowledge and agree that the costs and speeds of
                transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such
                as Polygon are variable and may increase or decrease
                dramatically at any time, resulting in prolonged inability to
                access or use any ETHs, NFTs, or other digital assets associated
                with the DR Center.

                <em>Regulatory Uncertainty.</em> Blockchain technologies and
                digital assets are subject to many legal and regulatory
                uncertainties, and the DR Center and NFTs could be adversely
                impacted by one or more regulatory or legal inquiries, actions,
                suits, investigations, claims, fines or judgments, which could
                impede or limit the ability of you to continue the use and
                enjoyment of such assets and technologies.

                <em>Cryptography Risks.</em> Cryptography is a progressing
                field. Advances in code cracking or technical advances such as
                the development of quantum computers may present risks to
                Polygon, the DR Center and NFTs, including the theft, loss or
                inaccessibility thereof.

                <em>Fork Handling.</em> Polygon, the DR Center System, and the
                NFTs may be subject to “forks.” Forks occur when some or all
                persons running the software clients for a particular blockchain
                system adopt a new client or a new version of an existing client
                that: (i) changes the protocol rules in backwards-compatible or
                backwards-incompatible manner that affects which transactions
                can be added into later blocks, how later blocks are added to
                the blockchain, or other matters relating to the future
                operation of the protocol; or (ii) reorganizes or changes past
                blocks to alter the history of the blockchain. Some forks are
                “contentious” and thus may result in two or more persistent
                alternative versions of the protocol or blockchain, either of
                which may be viewed as or claimed to be the legitimate or
                genuine continuation of the original. The Company may not be
                able to anticipate, control or influence the occurrence or
                outcome of forks, and does not assume any risk, liability or
                obligation in connection therewith. Without limiting the
                generality of the foregoing, the Company does not assume any
                responsibility to notify you of pending, threatened or completed
                forks. The Company will respond to any forks as the Company
                determines in its sole and absolute discretion, and the Company
                shall not have any duty or obligation or liability to you if
                such response (or lack of such response) acts to a user
                detriment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
                Company’s possible and permissible responses to a fork may
                include: (i) honoring the DR Center System, and NFTs on both
                chains; (ii) honoring the DR Center System and NFTs on only one
                of the chains; (iii) honoring the DR Center System and NFTs in
                different respects or to a different extent on both chains; or
                (iv) any other response or policy or procedure, as determined by
                the Company in its sole and absolute discretion. You assume full
                responsibility to independently remain apprised of and informed
                about possible forks, and to manage your own interests in
                connection therewith.

            <b>No Implied Waivers.</b> No failure or delay on the part of the
            Company in the exercise of any power, right, privilege or remedy
            under these Terms shall operate as a waiver of such power, right,
            privilege or remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such
            power, right, privilege or remedy shall preclude any other or
            further exercise thereof or of any other power, right, privilege or

            arising out of these Terms, or any power, right, privilege or remedy
            under these Terms, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right,
            privilege or remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument
            duly executed and delivered on behalf of the Company, and any such
            waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except in the
            specific instance in which it is given.{" "}
