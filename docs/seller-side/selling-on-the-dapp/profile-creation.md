#### What is a Lens profile and what are its benefits? <a href="#what-is-a-lens-profile-and-what-are-its-benefits" id="what-is-a-lens-profile-and-what-are-its-benefits"></a>

Lens Protocol is a composable and decentralized social graph. It lets creators take ownership of their content wherever they go in the world of Web3. While Boson Protocol allows for the trustless transfer and redemption of physical goods, using Lens allows you to build your reputation and associate yourself and your storefront with your digital presence elsewhere.

If you already have a Lens account, switch the toggle at the top right `Link Lens Profile` and you will see the Lens handle field is pre-populated with your handle. In the case when connecting your wallet does not detect an existing Lens profile, you will be prompted to create one.
