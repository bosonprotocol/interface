## Environments

Each deployment is hosted on IPFS with a custom domain.

For ease of use, each environment has a DNS name that always points to the latest IPFS hash: 

| Env          | Network   | Endpoint                                                        |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `testing`    | `mumbai` | https://interface-test.on.fleek.co/                             |
| `staging`    | `mumbai` | https://interface-staging.on.fleek.co/                          |
| `production` | `polygon` | https://dapp-interface-production.on.fleek.co/                                                           |

## Local development

### Node & npm

Installing the correct versions of node and npm can be done by installing [`volta`](https://volta.sh/). Volta will automatically get those versions from the package.json file. Once that's done, the required steps to develop and test the dApp interface locally are as follows:

1. Clone the repository: i.e. Run `git clone git@github.com:bosonprotocol/interface.git`
2. Navigate into the directory & install dependencies: i.e. Run `cd interface && npm ci`
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill out any necessary values.
4. Start the application: i.e. Run `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser.
